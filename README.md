Project BABA - Blockchain Administration based Agriculture

Someone said Never believe that a few caring people can't change the world. For, indeed, that's all who ever have.

Agriculture has been a core business since the evolution of mankind. A problem with a market share of humanity and a solution delivered by the hard work and preservance of self-less farmers. But at the end of the day, all we see big fat price hikes, corrupted supply chain, unacceptable payouts and what not. We know what we need to do. Our farmers have been waiting on us for a long system update and the government or judicial system wont get them that. But we can, technology can. We have seen how technology change the world before, its time that we deliver the rights our agriculture stakeholders which they deserve. 

Project BABA is a blockchain based farmer-to-consumer supply chain management system for better agriculture. It gives a open-source free solution to the problem of addressing market reach to farmers.

Note - Still working on the readme. Would love people showing developmental interests and throwing ideas.
